        Our project "RS Lang" started on 11.06.2020. RS Lang is an application for learning foreign words with interval
        repetition techniques. Since then, we have turned into a real development team. We come from different
        backgrounds, but we are all united by one common goal. The goal of becoming a professional developer. Here we
        are.
